# mod4-challenge

In this challenge we were tasked to create a quiz from scratch using Javascript and to use our knowledge of eventlisteners, conditionals, for loops, objects, arrays, and localstorage. The most trouble I had was being able to select an answer and validate if that was correct. Im still having trouble getting my local storage to render and to get the game to end properly when all the questions are answered. I still feel proud of what I was able to create considering it was created from scratch.

## User Story

- AS A coding boot camp student
